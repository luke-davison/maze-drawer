Luke's Maze Drawer

This was something I made prior to the EDA bootcamp (last week of phase 0).

I was quite proud of it at the time (well, I still am proud) but it is more of an indicator of what I previously could do.

Feel free to check it out at https://luke-davison.github.io/maze-drawer/

And do look at the code if you want an idea about how my code quality has increased since this time.
